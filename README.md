# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

## A fast, responsive app for booking and managing restaurant reservations.

### Synopsis

Users are able to add, modify, and remove reservations, add tables, and seat reservations at tables. This app could be used by a host or another front-of-house staff member at an most restaurants.

### Challenges

This project is my submission for Thinkful's final capstone for Flex Engineering. This project proved much more challenging than prior assignments for several reasons. Input validation was a complex process which needed to be handled on the back end, and then displayed in a sensible way on the front end. The app's responsiveness was tedious to design and implement while still making the flow feel natural.

Above all, the primary challenge of this assignment was how little was given upfront. Students are provided with a very minimal boilerplate, and are required to setup databases for each environment, connect the frontend to a backend and the backend to the data, create every component, design an API, run command line tests, and get it deployed.

### Instructions

> You have been hired as a full stack developer at _Periodic Tables_, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
> The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.
> At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

There are no user stories for deployment: it is expected that you will deploy the application to production after you finish a user story.

There are no user stories for logging: it is expected that you will add logging to the application with enough detail to help you diagnose issues in production.

### US-01 Create and list reservations

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I want to create a new reservation when a customer calls<br/>
so that I know how many customers will arrive at the restaurant on a given day.

### US-02 Create reservation on a future, working date

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I only want to allow reservations to be created on a day when we are open<br/>
so that users do not accidentally create a reservation for days when we are closed.<br/>

### US-03 Create reservation within eligible timeframe

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I only want to allow reservations to be created during business hours, up to 60 minutes before closing<br/>
so that users do not accidentally create a reservation for a time we cannot accommodate.

### US-04 Seat reservation

As a restaurant manager, <br/>
When a customer with an existing reservation arrives at the restaurant<br/>
I want to seat (assign) their reservation to a specific table<br/>
so that I know which tables are occupied and free.

### US-05 Finish an occupied table

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I want to free up an occupied table when the guests leave<br/>
so that I can seat new guests at that table.<br/>

### US-06 Reservation Status

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I want a reservation to have a status of either booked, seated, or finished<br/>
so that I can see which reservation parties are seated, and finished reservations are hidden from the dashboard.

### US-07 Search for a reservation by phone number

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I want to search for a reservation by phone number (partial or complete)<br/>
so that I can quickly access a customer's reservation when they call about their reservation.<br/>

### US-08 Change an existing reservation

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I want to be able to modify a reservation if a customer calls to change or cancel their reservation<br/>
so that reservations are accurate and current.
